# Advanced 1: Exercise 1: Madlibs Revisited  9 May 2017)

# Let's build another program using madlibs. We made a program like
# this in the easy exercises. This time, the requirements are a bit different.

# Make a madlibs program that reads in some text from a text file that
# you have created, and then plugs in a selection of randomized nouns,
# verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that text and prints it. You can
# build your lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs directly into
# your program, but the text data should come from a file or other external
# source. Your program should read this text, and for each line, it should
# place random words of the appropriate types into the text, and print the
# result.

# The challenge of this program isn't about writing your program; it's about
# choosing how to represent your data. Choose the right way to structure your
# data, and this problem becomes a whole lot easier. This is why we don't
# show you what the input data looks like; the input representation is
# your responsibility.

require 'yaml'

def madlib(text)
  words = YAML.load_file('words.yml')
  keys = words.keys

  text.gsub(/\b\w+\b/) { |word| keys.include?(word) ? words[word].sample : word }
end


text = YAML.load_file('text.txt')
p madlib(text)
